\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference, and conference
editors like ACM seek to give their conference by-products a uniform,
high-quality appearance. We also would like our proceedings to look highly
professional, so we're borrowing heavily from the ACM formatting guidelines.
These include some
rigid requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
the page, specified size of margins (2.54cm [1"] top and
bottom and 1.9cm [.75"] left and right; specified column width
(8.45cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.083cm [.33"]).

\todo[inline, color=green]{I really like this section.}

The good news is, with only a handful of manual
settings,\footnote{One of these, the \texttt{\textbackslash alignauthor} command, 
you have
already used; another, \texttt{\textbackslash balancecolumns} will
be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
balanced column heights on the last page.} the \LaTeX\ document
class file handles all of this for you.

The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
specifically available for denoting the structure of a
proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
or explanations of such commands. Section~\ref{sec:body} introduces the main
examples of formatting, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} wraps things up. 

\section{Backgrounds}
\label{sec:backgrounds}

\section{Factoring Personalized Markov Chain and its improvements}
\label{sec:fpmc}

As we have discussed in section \ref{sec:backgrounds}, MC and MF based recommender systems
have fairly distinct characteristics from each other. In this section, we will study a model called 
Factoring Personalized Markov Chain (FPMC) that incorporates MF into MC, and then its 
enhancements specializing in LSBN data properties.

\subsection{Formalizaion}
\label{sec:typeChangesSpecialChars}

Before we dive into the details, let us introduce the notation used in this paper. 
Let $U$ be a set of users and $L$ be a set of locations. For each user $u$ in $U$, 
we know their check-in history set \begin{math}L^t_u\end{math} where $t$ is a timestamp 
of the user visit. Our goal now is given the user check-in data 
\begin{math}L^1_u,...,L^t_u\end{math}, recommend a next location to 
a user $u$ at time $t + 1$.

\subsection{FPMC}
\label{sec:typeChangesSpecialChars}

Even though MC based recommender systems were widely studied and used because of 
its capacity to capture sequential data, it lacks the personalization feature to distinguish each user. 
MF also has its weakness in processing sequential information since it is often completely ignored 
to focus on the general taste of each user. The weakness is particularly problematic in LBSN. 
In LBSN, sequential information plays a huge role in that there is a strong connection 
between recently visited locations and future locations. For instance, people are likely to visit 
cinemas or bars after restaurants. However, a recommender system with no sequential awareness 
may recommend another restaurant to a user who just check-ined a restaurant; this is not ideal. 
To take advantage of both MF and MC models, Rendle et al. [2010] proposes factorizing personalized 
Markov chains (FPMC).

How does FPMC combine these two different techniques? The most straightforward solution that 
we can think of is having a personalized MC per user. Figure 3 shows four different transition matrices for each user. 
? entries mean we have no data 
to estimate the probability of the transition. As we can observe from the matrices, simply using 
personalized transition matrices produces poor estimations. We just do not have enough data from
each user. This is the place where the ideas of 
MF can be applied. By stacking all transition matrices of users, we can get a transition cube or tensor A. 
This is the essence of FPMC. Figure 4 represents the tensor for the same data from figure 3. 
Unlike the naive personalization MC approach, a factored tensor solves the sparsity problem and 
still has its personalization feature for individual users.

\begin{figure}
\psfig{file=Figure4(b).pdf,width=3in}
\caption{The inter check-in distance in km}
\label{fig:onlyOne}
\end{figure}

\subsection{FPMC-LR}
\label{sec:typeChangesSpecialChars}

FPMC successfully incorporates the information of the personalized Markov chain 
by combining MF and MC in CF. However, it overlooks another noticeable property 
of the LBSN datasets, localized region constraint. The figure ~\ref{fig:onlyOne}  
reports the distance of inter check-ins in Gowalla and Foursquare. It shows that 
more than 75\% of inter check-ins from Foursquare and 80\% of inter check-ins 
from Gowalla happened within 10 km. Only less than 5\% of inter check-ins occur 
more than 100km both in Foursquare and Gowalla. The observation on the LBSN 
shows the trend that users tend to check in places close to their previous check-ins, 
but the FPMC does not really make use of this potentially useful trend.

(Intro to FPMC-LR non-tech) To add the ability to use localized region constraint 
information into the existing personalized POI Markov chain, Cheng et al. [2013] 
introduces a model called FPMC-LR which combines FPMC model with localized 
region constraints to provide accurate successive POI recommendation in LBSNs. 
Because FPMC-LR only takes into account nearby candidate locations depending 
on where the users are, it reduces the computational costs and noisy information. 
Also, it results in more accurate predications as we will see in [section result].

(Math part) FPMC-LR model has a similar setting as FPMC since it is an improvement 
over it. Just like in FPMC, the fundamental goal of FPMC-LR is to give the most suitable 
location recommendation for user $u$ at time $t + 1$, given a sequence of check-ins. 
In other words, we need to calculate the probability of a user $u$ to visit a location $l$ at time $t$:
\begin{equation}
	x_{u,i,l}=p(l \in L_u^t | i \in L_u^{t-1})
\label{eq:summation}
\end{equation}
The main difference between FPMC and FPMC-LR is in their transition tensor. As we saw earlier, in FPMC, the model takes into account all possible locations for each user, so the tensor looks like: 
\begin{equation}
	\chi \in [0, 1]^{|U| \times |L| \times |L|}
\label{eq:summation}
\end{equation}
In FPMC-LR, the model only considers neighbor locations for each location l for each user. 
The tensor transition in FPMC-LR looks like:
\begin{equation}
	\chi \in [0, 1]^{|U| \times |L| \times |N_d(L)|}
\label{eq:summation}
\end{equation}
The neighbor locations \begin{math}N_d(L)\end{math} are calculated by Haversine formula, 
which is used to find the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. 
In this case, we assume the earth is a roughly sphere. After applying several steps of ranking techniques, 
we can get the final probability \begin{math}x_u,t,l\end{math}.



\section{Body}
\label{sec:body}

Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{\textbackslash section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
balance of this sample document.

Because the entire article is contained in
the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.

\subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
\label{sec:typeChangesSpecialChars}

We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
the command \texttt{\textbackslash textit}; emboldening with the
command \texttt{\textbackslash textbf}
and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
\texttt{\textbackslash texttt}.
As a rule you'd prefer \texttt{\textbackslash emph} (which stands for \emph{emphasize})
over something like \texttt{\textbackslash textit} since that gives the typesetting system
more flexibility in how it can emphasize that text.

You do not
have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
Let's make this a rather short one to
see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
document class file. Take care with the use
of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
the beginning and end of
the text that is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
you can find a complete list of what is
available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
User's Guide}~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Math Equations}
\label{sec:mathEquations}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\label{sec:inlineEquations}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{\textbackslash begin\ldots\textbackslash end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$\ldots \$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
\label{sec:displayEquations}

A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:

\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation*}

Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:

\begin{displaymath}
	\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}

and follow it with a numbered equation (Equation~\ref{eq:summation}):

\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\label{eq:summation}
\end{equation}

just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.
Note that if you use numbered equations, you can give them \texttt{label}s
and \texttt{\textbackslash ref} them, e.g., Equation~\ref{eq:summation}.

\subsection{Multi-line formulas}
\label{sec:multiLineFormulas}

The \texttt{align} and \texttt{align*} environments let you align sequences of
equations so, for examples, a sequences of equal signs line up nicely. 

% The & creates a "virtual tab stop" and corresponding &'s on each line
% will be aligned when the layout is done.
\begin{align*}
n_1 &= \sum_{i = 1}^k a_i \\
n_{x-y} &= \prod_{i = 1}^k b_i
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
 f(x) &= (x+a)(x+b) \\
 &= x^2 + (a+b)x + ab
\end{align*}

\subsection{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of
a \textbf{.pdf} file to be displayable with \LaTeX, such as
Figure~\ref{fig:singleColumnFigure}.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\psfig{file=sample_graph.pdf,width =3in}
\caption{A sample graph just spanning one column.}
\label{fig:singleColumnFigure}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns, like Figure~\ref{fig:twoColumnFigure}.  
To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\texttt{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
And don't forget to end the environment with
\texttt{figure*}, not \texttt{figure}!

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\psfig{file=sample_graph.pdf,width =5.3in}
\caption{A sample graph that needs to span two columns of text.}
\label{fig:twoColumnFigure}
\end{figure*}

It's easiest and you tend to get the best quality if your figure uses vector graphics
in PDF format. You can include other formats such as PNG, but they will usually
not look nearly as professional, especially when printed on high resolution printers.
\emph{Be very wary of screen captures from other papers. They tend to look pixelated
and amateurish even at high resolutions.}

\subsection{Tables}
\label{sec:tables}

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:frequencyOfSpecialChars} is included in the input file; 
compare the placement of the table here with the table in the
PDF output running \LaTeX\ on this document.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\label{tab:frequencyOfSpecialChars}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|l}
Non-English or Math & Frequency & Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000 & For Swedish names\\
$\pi$ & 1 in 5 & Common in math\\
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000 & Unexplained usage\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption, as demonstrated in Table~\ref{tab:typicalCommands} below.  
As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:typicalCommands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}[t]
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\label{tab:typicalCommands}
\begin{tabular}{ccl}
Command & A Number & Comments \\ \hline
\texttt{\textbackslash alignauthor}     & 100 & Author alignment\\
\texttt{\textbackslash numberofauthors} & 200 & Author enumeration\\
\texttt{\textbackslash table}           & 300 & For tables\\
\texttt{\textbackslash table*}          & 400 & For wider tables\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Citations}
\label{sec:citations}

Citations to articles~\cite{Aaronson:2005,Garey:1979,Brun:2008} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file~\cite{OM:2008}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

It is recommended that you precede \texttt{\textbackslash cite} (and 
\texttt{\textbackslash ref}) commands with a tilde
character instead of a space, e.g., \texttt{some text\textasciitilde\textbackslash cite}. The tilde gives you a non-breaking space which ensures that your citation won't get
stranded by itself on the beginning of a line.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{\textbackslash cite},
which is all that is needed for our senior seminar.
You shouldn't use any other forms here.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\label{sec:theoremLikeConstructs}

Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{\textbackslash newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

Theorem~\ref{thm:integration} below uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} command:

% You would usually put a \newtheorem command up at the top 
% of your LaTeX document after the \usepackage commands. It's
% just here in this example so it's with the text that describes it.
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\label{thm:integration}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{align*}
l &= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) \\
  &= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ] \\
  &= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}  \\
  &= 0\cdot L  \\
  &= 0,
\end{align*}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition~\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} or the
\texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
\label{sec:caveatForExperts}

Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{\textbackslash def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{\textbackslash def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
\label{sec:acknowledgments}

This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.

You want to use the \texttt{\textbackslash section*} version of the \texttt{section}
command, as an acknowledgments section typically does \emph{not} get
a number.

It is common (but by no means necessary) for students to thank
their advisor, and possibly other faculty, friends, and family who provided
useful feedback on the paper as it was being written.

In the present case, for example, the
authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
% sample_paper.bib is the name of the BibTex file containing the
% bibliography entries. Note that you *don't* include the .bib ending here.
\bibliography{sample_paper}  
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references

\end{document}
